    # Create a usage record
    post:
      description: |
        Creates a usage record for a specified subscription item and date, and fills it with a quantity.

        Usage records provide `quantity` information that Stripe uses to track how much a customer is using your service. With usage information and the pricing model set up by the [metered billing](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/metered-billing) plan, Stripe helps you send accurate invoices to your customers.

        The default calculation for usage is to add up all the `quantity` values of the usage records within a billing period. You can change this default behavior with the billing planâ€™s `aggregate_usage` [parameter](https://stripe.com/docs/api/plans/create#create_plan-aggregate_usage). When there is more than one usage record with the same timestamp, Stripe adds the quantity values together. In most cases, this is the desired resolution, however, you can change this behavior with the `action` parameter.

        The default pricing model for metered billing is [per-unit](https://stripe.com/docs/api/plans/object#plan_object-billing_scheme) pricing. For finer granularity, you can configure metered billing to have a [tiered](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/tiers) pricing model.
      parameters:
        # Subscription item ID
        - name: subscription_item
          in: path
          required: true
          type: string
          description: The ID of the subscription item for this usage record.
        - name: quantity
          in: formData
          required: true
          type: string
          description: The usage quantity for the specified timestamp.
        - name: action
          in: formData
          required: false
          type: string
          enum:
            - increment
            - set
          description: |
            Valid values are `increment` (default) or `set`. When using `increment` the specified quantity will be added to the usage at the specified timestamp. The `set` action will overwrite the usage quantity at that timestamp. If the subscription has [billing thresholds](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-billing_thresholds), increment is the only allowed value.
        - name: timestamp
          in: formData
          required: false
          type: string
          description: The timestamp for the usage event. This timestamp must be within the current billing period of the subscription of the provided `subscription_item`, and must not be in the future. When passing `"now"`, Stripe records usage for the current time. Default is `"now"` if a value is not provided.

  /subscription_items/{subscription_item}/usage_record_summaries:
    # Lists usage record summaries
    get:
      description: |
        For the specified subscription item, returns a list of summary objects. Each object in the list provides usage information thatâ€™s been summarized from multiple usage records and over a subscription billing period (e.g., 15 usage records in the billing planâ€™s month of September).

        The list is sorted in reverse-chronological order (newest first). The first list item represents the most current usage period that hasnâ€™t ended yet. Since new usage records can still be added, the returned summary information for the subscription itemâ€™s ID should be seen as unstable until the subscription billing period ends.
      parameters:
        # Subscription item ID
        - name: subscription_item
          in: path
          required: true
          type: string
          description: Only summary items for the given subscription item.
        - name: ending_before
          in: query
          required: false
          type: string
          description: A cursor for use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include `ending_before=obj_bar` in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
        - name: limit
          in: query
          required: false
          type: integer
          maximum: 100
          minimum: 1
          description: A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.
        - name: starting_after
          in: query
          required: false
          type: string
          description: A cursor for use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include `starting_after=obj_foo` in order to fetch the next page of the list
